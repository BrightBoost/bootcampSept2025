# Bonus content

In case you're familiar with the topics of the lectures in the main room, we wouldn't want you to be bored. That's why we compiled a document with extra content and extra exercises. If you're also familiar with the topics below and you'd rather do a hands on project in these days (or work on the hackathon), that's allowed to.
