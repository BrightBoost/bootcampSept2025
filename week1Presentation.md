# Afternoon Presentation Session: Sprint 1 Wrap-Up

### **Structure of the Presentation (all teams)**

Each team should prepare a short presentation (\~10 minutes) with **all members speaking**. Use slides, a shared doc, or a whiteboard (or be creative).

It must include the following:

**Slide / Section 1 – Team Introduction**

* Team name (be creative 🎉).
* Members and quick today's role description (e.g. “I focused on database design”, “I worked on Jira setup”).
* One sentence about your *strength* as a team.

**Slide / Section 2 – Team Plan**

* How did you divide the work in Sprint 1?
* How did you use Jira / Bitbucket (show your board, repo)?
* What agile practices did you try (standups, check-ins, pair programming)?

**Slide / Section 3 – Strengths & Weaknesses**

* Individual/team strengths noticed today.
* Weaknesses or difficulties (technical or teamwork).
* How do you want to improve in Sprint 2?

**Slide / Section 4 – Conflict Resolution Plan**

* How will you handle disagreements in the next sprint? (e.g. vote, rotate responsibility, ask for instructor help).
* How will you make sure *everyone’s voice is heard*?

**Slide / Section 5 – What We Built Today**

* Show your **MySQL database schema** and dummy data.
* Show the **SQL script in Bitbucket**.
* If possible, demonstrate creating the database locally.


### **Process Requirements (for teams)**

* **Everyone must present**: each member speaks at least once (even if just for 1 slide).
* **Show real artifacts**: screenshots of Jira board, Bitbucket repo, database schema.
* **Keep it short and clear**: max 10 min per team.
* **Answer one reflection question each**:
  * What did you personally learn today?
  * What surprised you about working in a team?
  * What’s one thing you’ll try differently in the next sprint?
