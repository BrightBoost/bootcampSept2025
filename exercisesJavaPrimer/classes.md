1. **Book Class**
   Create a `Book` class with properties `title`, `author`, and `numberOfPages`. Make sure to create a constructor to initialize these properties. Add a method called `printInfo()` that prints all of this information to the console. Then, create several Book objects in your main method and call `printInfo()` on them.

2. **Student Class**
   Create a `Student` class with properties `name`, `age`, `grade` and `major`. Include a constructor and a method called `displayStudentInfo()` that prints all of the information about the student. In your main method, create several Student objects and call `displayStudentInfo()` on them.

3. **BankAccount Class**
   Create a `BankAccount` class with properties `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName` and `balance`. Include a constructor to initialize these properties. Add methods to deposit and withdraw money, as well as a method to display the current balance. In your main method, create a BankAccount object and test your deposit, withdraw, and display balance methods.

4. **Rectangle Class**
   Create a `Rectangle` class with properties `length` and `width`. Include a constructor to initialize these properties. Add methods to calculate the area (`length * width`) and the perimeter (`2 * (length + width)`). In your main method, create a Rectangle object, then call and print the results of your area and perimeter methods.

5. **Circle Class**
   Create a `Circle` class with a property `radius`. Include a constructor to initialize this property. Add methods to calculate the circumference (`2 * PI * radius`) and the area (`PI * radius * radius`). Use `Math.PI` for the value of PI. In your main method, create a Circle object, then call and print the results of your circumference and area methods.
