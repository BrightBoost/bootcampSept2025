1. **Animal and Dog Class**
   Create a superclass `Animal` with properties like `name`, `age`, and `weight`, and methods such as `eat()` and `sleep()`. Then create a subclass `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and includes additional properties like `breed`, and methods such as `bark()`. Create several Dog objects in your main method and call various methods on them.

2. **Person, Employee, and Manager Class**
   Create a superclass `Person` with properties like `name` and `address`, and methods to display this information. Then create a subclass `Employee` that inherits from `Person` and adds additional properties like `employeeID` and `salary`, and methods to display this information. Finally, create another subclass `Manager` that inherits from `Employee` and adds additional properties like `teamSize`. In your main method, create several Manager objects and call various methods on them.

3. **Shape, Circle, and Rectangle Class**
   Create an abstract class `Shape` with properties `color` and an abstract method `area()`. Then create subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from `Shape` and implement the `area()` method (for Circle, `area = PI*radius*radius`; for Rectangle, `area = length*width`). Create several Circle and Rectangle objects in your main method and call the `area()` method on them.

4. **Vehicle, Car, and Bike Class**
   Create a superclass `Vehicle` with properties like `brand` and `speed`, and methods to display this information. Then create subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that inherit from `Vehicle` and add additional properties and methods specific to them (for Car, add `numberOfDoors`; for Bike, add `hasBell`). In your main method, create several Car and Bike objects and call various methods on them.

5. **Product, Book, and ElectronicDevice Class**
   Create a superclass `Product` with properties like `name` and `price`, and methods to display this information. Then create subclasses `Book` and `ElectronicDevice` that inherit from `Product` and add additional properties and methods specific to them (for Book, add `author` and `numberOfPages`; for ElectronicDevice, add `brand` and `warrantyPeriod`). In your main method, create several Book and ElectronicDevice objects and call various methods on them.
