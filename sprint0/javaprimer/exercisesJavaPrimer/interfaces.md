1. **Flyable Interface**
   Create an interface `Flyable` with methods `fly()` and `land()`. Then create classes `Bird` and `Airplane` that implement this interface and define these methods in their own way. In your main method, create objects of `Bird` and `Airplane` and call these methods.

2. **Calculable Interface**
   Create an interface `Calculable` with methods `add(int a, int b)`, `subtract(int a, int b)`, `multiply(int a, int b)`, and `divide(int a, int b)`. Then create a class `Calculator` that implements this interface. In the main method, create an object of `Calculator` and call these methods.

3. **Drivable and Rentable Interfaces**
   Create interfaces `Drivable` with methods `start()`, `stop()`, `accelerate()`, `brake()` and `Rentable` with methods `rent()`, `returnItem()`. Then, create a `Car` class that implements both `Drivable` and `Rentable` interfaces.

4. **Drawable and Rotatable Interfaces**
   Create two interfaces `Drawable` with method `draw()` and `Rotatable` with method `rotate()`. Then, create classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement both interfaces and define these methods.

5. **Sortable Interface**
   Create an interface `Sortable` with a method `sort(int[] array)`. Then create a class `BubbleSort` that implements this interface and sorts an array using Bubble Sort algorithm.
